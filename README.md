# Tic-Tac-Toe
Made a simple tic-tac-toe game for The Odin Project.
Used factory functions to make the game logic.
Added two event listeners to connect the game functions with the DOM.

# TODO
Make it prettier.
Change the 'O' and 'X' from text to a draw-like animated 'O' and 'X'.
Change the alert of who won to maybe a more customisable dialog window.
